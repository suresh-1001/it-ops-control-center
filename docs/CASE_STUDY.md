## Case Study — Daily Impact for Senior IT Systems & Security Specialist / IT Manager

**Problem:** Fragmented tools (HRIS, Workspace, Slack, Jira, MDM, Prometheus) cause slow onboarding, poor visibility, and audit scramble.

**Solution:** A single control center that automates joiner/mover/leaver flows, surfaces infra + VPN health, and tracks SOC 2 control status.

**Results (benchmarks to target):**
- Onboarding time: ~60 minutes (from request → accounts → device policy)
- Visibility: VM/VPN uptime panels with 24h retention; alert on failure
- Compliance: daily SOC 2 status JSON; auditor-ready evidence bundles

**Where it maps to the JDs**
- *Hearth – Senior IT Systems & Security Specialist*: SOC 2 readiness, Jira automations, Google Workspace + Slack optimization, macOS fleet focus.
- *Cyngn – IT Manager*: virtualization + network heartbeat, helpdesk/ticketing improvements, device provisioning, and vendor/license hygiene.

**Demo flow**
1. Generate onboarding plan → Slack invite + Workspace groups + Intune policy (stubs now, real adapters pluggable).
2. Prometheus exporter updates VM/VPN metrics; Grafana dashboard reflects health.
3. SOC 2 collector writes pass/fail; FastAPI UI shows current compliance posture.
